# Current System Status

**Last Updated**: 2026-10-07  
**Current Milestone Completed**: Milestone 2.2 (Flagged Incident Log Ingestion & Multi-Agent Incident Analysis Engine)  
**Verification Status**: Verified by user test execution (10/10 automated tests passing + Live 3-Agent Collaborative LLM reasoning verified with Google Gemini)  

---

## 1. Completed & Implemented Components

- **FastAPI Core (`app/main.py`)**: Application bootstrap, health check endpoint (`/health`), alerts router, and incidents router.
- **Incident & Flagged Log Models (`app/models/incident.py`)**: `FlaggedLog`, `Incident`, `TimelineEvent`, `MitreItem`, `AffectedEntities`, and `IncidentReport` schemas.
- **Alert Ingestion Models (`app/models/alert.py`, `app/api/alerts.py`)**: `Alert` schema, `AlertAcknowledgement`, and `POST /api/v1/alerts`.
- **3-Agent Collaborative LLM Pipeline (`app/agents/multi_agent_pipeline.py`)**:
  - `ForensicInvestigatorAgent` (`app/agents/forensic_investigator.py`): DFIR specialist for execution tree reconstruction and payload deobfuscation.
  - `ThreatAnalystAgent` (`app/agents/threat_analyst.py`): CTI specialist mapping observables to MITRE ATT&CK and evaluating blast radius.
  - `ResponseAdvisorAgent` (`app/agents/response_advisor.py`): Incident Commander synthesizing verdicts and tactical containment checklists.
- **Incident Analysis API Route (`app/api/incidents.py`)**: `POST /api/v1/incidents/analyze` returning full structured `IncidentReport`.
- **CLI Incident Runner (`run_incident_analysis.py`)**: Terminal tool executing live multi-agent reasoning on arbitrary incident log files with colorized output.
- **Read-Only Telemetry Tools (`app/tools/`)**: `get_process_logs` and `get_network_logs`.
- **Automated Test Suites (`tests/`)**:
  - `tests/test_incident_analysis.py`: Unit and API tests for multi-agent incident analysis, timeline sequencing, and MITRE mapping.
  - `tests/test_investigation.py`: Unit and integration tests for telemetry tools and alert investigation.
- **Living Documentation**: ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003, `documentation/api/incident-api.md`, `documentation/api/alert-api.md`, `documentation/agents/multi-agent-system.md`, `documentation/development/`.
